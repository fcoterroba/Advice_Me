## How can I contribute?

You have to submit your quotes **in English** through making a pull request. You have to add your quote in the `background.js` file. **Please** add your quote in the last line.

If you don't know about Git, you can make an issue too.

### Example for make a PR with new quotes

Edit this [js file](https://github.com/fcoterroba/Advice_Me/blob/main/background.js) and you'll see this first line

```js
var randomArray = [
    "“All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them.”",
    "........",
    "“That's my new quote”"
```

Remember add **comma** at the end of the sentence if you are going to write more than one.

Remember that your last quote or the last line WON'T have a **comma**

## Update for Hacktoberfest

Hacktoberfest is a promotion run by DigitalOcea every October in order to encourage developers to contribute to open-source projects on GitHub. You can read more info in [their official website](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)

This repository has been accepted in order to accept Hacktoberfest issues.

Remember that only merges made between 1 and 31 October will be valid. I'll try not merge anything before 1st October, but I ask for don't do PR until then too. You can "reserve" some issues by requesting it and doing the PR in October
